<h2 align="center">An All-Purpose Audio Recording App</h2>

<p align="center">
Version 0.3.0
</p>

<p>
Orecchiette is an app used to record all sorts of audio: input from the
microphone, output from the speaker, or both together.  It can, therefore,
be used to record phone calls.  If a bluetooth "handsfree" device is present
(and in use), it will automatically be used to source audio data rather than
the cellphone's builtin microphone and speaker.
