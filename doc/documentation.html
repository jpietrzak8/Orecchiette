Orecchiette Voice Recorder

<h1>Orecchiette Documentation</h1>

<p>
Orecchiette is an app dedicated mainly towards recording voice data.
This data can be retrieved from the phone's built-in microphone, the
microphone attached to the pluggable ear-phones, or from a Bluetooth
headset.  Orecchiette can also record audio streams being sent to the
phone's output devices (again, either built-in or Bluetooth).  By
recording both streams in tandem, Orecchiette can be used to record
phone calls.
</p>

<h2>Warnings!</h2>

<p>
The process of compressing and encoding audio data can be CPU-intensive.
Depending on the encoding method chosen, Orecchiette may require up to 50% or
more of the CPU's time.  As such, it may be best to avoid running other
CPU-intensive programs when recording important audio.  Similarly, it may
be best to avoid using Orecchiette when the phone needs to concentrate on a
more important task.
</p>

<p>
Also, recorded audio data can consume a great deal of storage space.  To
simplify managing audio files (and extend the life of your phone's internal
storage system), it might be a good idea to install an external memory
card, and enter its path into the Preferences window.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there are laws that restrict how phone calls can be recorded.  In
many localities, it is sufficient for "one party" of a conversation to consent
to being recorded; thus, you may record your own calls without restriction.
But some places require all parties of a conversation to consent to having
the call recorded.  In any case, it is considered "best practice" to
announce at the beginning of any conversation if it is going to be recorded.
Please check your local communications laws before recording phone calls.
</p>

<h2>How to use Orecchiette</h2>

<p>
For basic audio recording, the options on the Orecchiette main window are
fairly straightforward.  First, at the top of the screen you have the choice
of two audio streams.  "Input" will set up the app to retrieve input from
a microphone; use this setting when, for example, you want to record a voice
note.  Output will record audio being sent to the speakers or earphones; use
this setting when, for example, you want to record audio from the built-in FM
radio receiver.
</p>

<p>
To start recording, simply click the "Record" button in the center of the
screen.  Please note that recording may not begin immediately!  Depending
on the amount of setup required for the audio stream, it may take a few
seconds before it is ready to record.  The icon on the Record button will
turn red once recording has started, and the Status message directly above
the Record button will describe the current status of the app.
</p>

<p>
To stop recording, just press the "Record" button a second time.
</p>

<p>
Recorded audio can be played back using the controls at the bottom of the
screen.  When you press the "Play" button, a file selection dialog will
be presented to you.  Currently, Orecchiette stores audio files using names
that start with "Recording_" and end with an index number; choose one of
these, and Orecchiette will begin playing it back for you.  (You can use
the phone's volume rocker switch to raise or lower the volume.)
</p>

<p>
The "Pause" button will allow you to pause Orecchiette both during a
recording and during playback.  Similarly, the "Stop" button will stop
either recording or playback.  The status message above the "Record" button
should provide some feedback to what state Orecchiette is currently in.
Again, please note that Orecchiette may not respond instantly to these
commands; it may take time for the audio subsystem to halt or restart the
process of managing the data streams.
</p>

<h3>Preferences</h3>

<p>
Orecchiette can be customized in a variety of ways, via the Preferences
window.  To open this window, tap the pull-down menu at the top of the
screen, and select "Preferences".
</p>

<p>
The first option is "Audio Encoding".  There are a handful of options
available, including "SPX", "AAC", "WAV", and "FLAC".
</p>

<p>
The second option is the "Save Folder".  This is the default location where
recordings will be stored.  As noted previously, it might be a good idea
to store recordings on a removable card, rather than using the phone's
internal storage.
</p>

<p>
The third option is a limit on the number of recorded files.  Orecchiette
tags each filename with an index number; when the index values reach a
maximum limit (20 by default), it will reset the index back to one.  In
effect, this means that after 20 recordings have been made, Orecchiette
will start over-writing the existing files, starting back at #1.  You can
choose to increase or decrease this limit, or remove the limit entirely.
</p>

<p>
Last on the list is the option to record phone calls.  If you mark this
checkbox, Orecchiette will automatically begin recording all phone calls
(both incoming and outgoing).  However, it will only do so for as long
as the app itself is running; thus, you will need to keep Orecchiette open
continuously if you want to record all incoming phone calls.
</p>

<h2>Notes on design</h2>

<p>
Orecchiette was initially designed as a re-write of the N900 widget
"Recaller".  (My thanks to talk.maemo.org member Estel for pressing me to
attempt this!)  Although it started out following the original code, a lot
was dropped in the conversion from a Python widget to a C++ app, and a lot
more was dropped as I learned the details of GStreamer.  At this point, I'd
have to say that the only real similarity between the two programs is that
they both record audio...
</p>

<p>
I read somewhere (need to find the link) that the author of Recaller
decided against supporting the SPX encoding format because "it didn't work
well on Windows".  In honor of this statement, I have made SPX the default
encoding format for Orecchiette!  (You can still choose your own preferred
encoding on the Preferences window.)
</p>

<h2>What's up with the name of this app?</h2>

<p>
Lately, I've been naming my personal coding projects after various forms
of pasta.  In Italian, "orecchiette" means "little ear", or so I'm told,
which seemed appropriate for the function of this app.
