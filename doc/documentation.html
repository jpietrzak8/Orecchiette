Orecchiette Voice Recorder
</title>

<h1>Orecchiette Documentation</h1>

<p>
Orecchiette is an app dedicated mainly towards recording voice data.
This data can be retrieved from the phone's built-in microphone, the
microphone attached to the pluggable ear-phones, or from a Bluetooth
headset.  Orecchiette can also record audio streams being sent to the
phone's output devices (again, either built-in or Bluetooth).  By
recording both streams in tandem, Orecchiette can be used to record
phone calls.
</p>

<h2>Warnings!</h2>

<p>
The process of compressing and encoding audio data can be CPU-intensive.
Depending on the encoding method chosen, Orecchiette may require up to 50% or
more of the CPU's time.  As such, it may be best to avoid running other
CPU-intensive programs when recording important audio.  Similarly, it may
be best to avoid using Orecchiette when the phone needs to concentrate on a
more important task.
</p>

<p>
Also, recorded audio data can consume a great deal of storage space.  To
simplify managing audio files (and extend the life of your phone's internal
storage system), it might be a good idea to install an external memory
card, and enter its path into the Preferences window.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there are laws that restrict how phone calls can be recorded.  In
many localities, it is sufficient for "one party" of a conversation to consent
to being recorded; thus, you may record your own calls without restriction.
But some places require all parties of a conversation to consent to having
the call recorded.  In any case, it is considered "best practice" to
announce at the beginning of any conversation if it is going to be recorded.
Please check your local communications laws before recording phone calls.
</p>

<h2>How to use Orecchiette</h2>

<p>
For basic audio recording, the options on the Orecchiette main window are
fairly straightforward.  First, at the top of the screen you have the choice
of two audio streams.  <b>Microphone</b> will set up the app to retrieve input
from a microphone; use this setting when, for example, you want to record a voice
note.  <b>Speaker</b> will record audio being sent to the speakers or earphones;
use this setting when, for example, you want to record audio from the built-in
FM radio receiver.  And you can choose to combine <b>Both</b> streams into a
recording; generally, this is only useful for recording phone conversations.
</p>

<p>
If an external device (headphones or BlueTooth) is connected, it will
automatically be used as an input and/or output instead of the built-in
microphone and/or speaker.
</p>

<p>
Orecchiette will save the current audio source selection on exit and
automatically select the same source the next time it is started up.
This feature is of particular importance in conjunction with the "Start
recording on start-up" option described further down this document.
</p>

<p>
To start recording, simply click the <b>Record</b> button in the center of
the screen.  Please note that recording may not begin immediately!  Depending
on the amount of setup required for the audio stream, it may take a few
seconds before it is ready to record.  The icon on the <b>Record</b> button
will turn red once recording has started, and the Status message directly
above the <b>Record</b> button will describe the current status of the app.
</p>

<p>
To stop recording, just press the <b>Stop</b> button or the <b>Record</b>
button for a second time.
</p>

<p>
Recorded audio can be played back using the controls at the bottom of the
screen.  When you press the <b>Play</b> button, a file selection dialog will
be presented to you.  You can use the phone's volume rocker switch to raise
or lower the volume during the playback.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Pause</b> button will allow you to pause Orecchiette both during a
recording or a playback.  Similarly, the <b>Stop</b> button will stop either
a recording or a playback.  The status message above the <b>Record</b> button
should provide some feedback to what state Orecchiette is currently in.
Again, please note that Orecchiette may not respond instantly to these
commands; it may take time for the audio subsystem to halt or restart the
process of managing the data streams.
</p>

<h3>Preferences</h3>

<p>
Orecchiette can be customized in a variety of ways, via the Preferences
window.  To open this window, tap the pull-down menu at the top of the
screen, and select <b>Preferences</b>.
</p>

<p>
The first option is <b>Audio Encoding</b>.  <!--There are a handful of options
available, including "SPX", "AAC", "WAV", and "FLAC".-->
Currently only "AAC" and "WAV" audio formats are supported.  Work is underway
to add other formats, such as "SPX" and "FLAC".
</p>

<p>
The second option is <b>Save Folder</b>.  This is the default location
where recordings will be stored.  As noted previously, it might be a good idea
to store recordings on a removable card, rather than using the phone's
internal storage.
</p>

<p>
The third option is <b>File Name Format</b>.  By default, Orecchiette will use
the string "Recording_", followed by the current number of recording.  This can
be changed pressing the <b>Edit Format String</b> button, which will open a new
dialog where you can type your own format. Orecchiette accepts a subset of the
format specifiers familiar from the Unix "date" command: %a, %d, %m, %M and so
on, plus it defines a few of its own, for example %o for the recording number.
For a full list of all supported format specifiers including the explanations,
press the small <b>%%</b> button to the right of the edit box to bring up a
drop-down list. Selecting an item from this list will insert the specifier at
the current cursor position in the edit box.  The <b>Validate</b> button resolves
the format and <b>Save</b> saves it, so the next recording will be created using
this name. Please note that the <b>Validate</b> button resolves the format using
the current date and time, the actual file name may be different.
</p>

<p>
The fourth option is <b>Max Number of Files</b>.  Orecchiette will automatically
delete older files before a new file is created to keep the number within this
limit.  The default limit is 20; this means that after 20 recordings,
Orecchiette will delete the oldest file to make room for a new recording.
You can choose to increase or decrease this limit to anywhere between 1 and 99,
or remove the limit entirely by ticking <b>No Limit to Number of Recordings</b>.
</p>

<p>
Please note that the way this works is that Orecchiette keeps a list of used
file names, including full paths, so old files are deleted even when the
<b>Save Folder</b> has changed.  When a file is deleted, it is also removed
from the list.  A file is deleted just before a new file is created.
In other words, the file will be deleted even if creating a new file fails.
Conversely, if deleting the old file fails (for example because it is locked
by another application), it will not be deleted but it will still be removed
from the list and will not be attempted to delete again.  Also, selecting
<b>No Limit to Number of Recordings</b> stops files from being deleted, but
the list is still being maintained, to the length specified by <b>Max Number
of Files</b>.  That means that Orecchiette may leave some files behind if
<b>Max Number of Files</b> or <b>No Limit to Number of Recordings</b> changes.
</p>

<p>
The next option is <b>Start Recording on Start-up</b>.  As the name suggests,
when ticked, it will behave on the next start of Orecchiette as if the user
pressed the <b>Record</b> buttom immediately after the start.  Note that just
like when starting the recording manually, it may take a few seconds before
the audio subsystem is set up and the actual recording starts.  The audio
source used for the recording on start-up will be the one selected at the
time Orecchiette was last closed.
</p>

<p>
Last on the list is the option to <b>Record Phone Calls</b>.  If you mark this
checkbox, Orecchiette will automatically begin recording all phone calls
(both incoming and outgoing).  However, it will only do so for as long
as the app itself is running; thus, you will need to keep Orecchiette open
continuously if you want to record all incoming phone calls.
</p>

<h2>Notes on design</h2>

<p>
Orecchiette was initially designed as a re-write of the N900 widget
"Recaller".  (My thanks to talk.maemo.org member Estel for pressing me to
attempt this!)  Although it started out following the original code, a lot
was dropped in the conversion from a Python widget to a C++ app, and a lot
more was dropped as I learned the details of GStreamer.  At this point, I'd
have to say that the only real similarity between the two programs is that
they both record audio...
</p>

<!-- <p>
I read somewhere (need to find the link) that the author of Recaller
decided against supporting the SPX encoding format because "it didn't work
well on Windows".  In honor of this statement, I have made SPX the default
encoding format for Orecchiette!  (You can still choose your own preferred
encoding on the Preferences window.)
</p> -->

<h2>What's up with the name of this app?</h2>

<p>
Lately, I've been naming my personal coding projects after various forms
of pasta.  In Italian, "orecchiette" means "little ear", or so I'm told,
which seemed appropriate for the function of this app.
