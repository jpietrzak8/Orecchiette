orecchiette (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=low
  * Fixed a bug in the encoding selection UI; only AAC was being used, despite the user's choice.
  * Reduced encoding choices to AAC and WAV; recordings made using Flac and Speex are coming out corrupted.  Needs more investigation.
  * Added a "combined streams" option to main window; this will allow users to record phone calls manually.
