Orecchiette
===========

An All-Purpose Audio Recording App for the Nokia N900

Orecchiette aims to be a general-purpose recording application, able to
record audio input from the microphone (for voice notes and the like),
audio streamed to the speakers (such as from the builtin FM radio), and
both at the same time (for recording phone calls).  It takes inspiration
from the widget "Recaller".
